This application is created as part of the Codecademy "Mixed Messages" portfolio project, and generates unique messages in command-line interface on each run.

Functionality

>>Selects a random "Dad" joke from a predefined array.
>>Combines the joke with a randomly chosen verb and noun.
>>Insertes a preposition that corresponds to the selected verb.
